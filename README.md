Features
------------

* **Create Secure Bitcoin Wallets** — With CreateSendBitcoin you can create bitcoin wallets with the ease-of-use that MyEtherWallet offers Ethereum users.

* **Send Bitcoin by Creating the Transaction on Your Computer** — No need to trust third-parties to handle your bitcoin. There are other interfaces out there like Coinb.in and Bitaddress.org; however, for people new to bitcoin and also for people who want less hassle, C/S B offers an easy alternative.

* **Secure & Encrypt Existing Wallets** — Most paper wallets are generated in BitAddress; however, these private keys are not encrypted. If someone discovers them, he or she can easily take your bitcoins. We offer a completely offline solution for encrypting those keys securely for more peace of mind.

* **Modeled After MyEtherWallet** — You might have noticed that the user-flow is very similar to MyEtherWallet. That is no coincidence. We modeled the design after MyEtherWallet and added a dark theme to easily identify which platform you are on. We will continue in this way as we add new features like Multisig wallet generation, multi-sig wallet bitcoin transactions, and the addition of other bitcoin blockchains (like Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, etc).
